### Project Overview

#### you’ll start building a Flask project, which could become a public message board at some point.

#### A basic Flask project with two pages that inherit content and style from a parent template.

### Get Started

#### you’ll prepare the development environment for your Flask project. First, you’ll create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies that you need for your project.

#### Create a Virtual Environment

   
  * you’ll build your project structure. You can name the root folder of your project any way you like. For example, you could name it rp_flask_board/ if your ultimate goal is to create a message board. 
   
  * If you have another project in mind, then feel free to name your folder accordingly. Create your folder and navigate into it:

  ` $ mkdir rp_flask_board`
  
  ` $ cd rp_flask_board `
